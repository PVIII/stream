# stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PVIII/stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PVIII/stream)

This library tries to combine the upcoming C++20 feature [Ranges](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/ranges) and ideas from the [boost ASIO](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) library.

The idea is to provide building blocks for flexible asynchronous low-level drivers.
